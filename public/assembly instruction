🔧 ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS

Arduino-Based Refrigerator Monitoring System

Step 1️⃣ – Prepare the Workspace

Keep a dry table (no moisture)

Tools needed:

Arduino Nano

Breadboard

Jumper wires

USB cable

Do not power the circuit while wiring

Step 2️⃣ – Mount Arduino Nano on Breadboard

Insert the Arduino Nano into the breadboard

Ensure both rows of pins are firmly seated

Keep USB port facing outward for easy connection

Step 3️⃣ – Connect the DHT22 Sensor (Temperature & Humidity)
Pin Connections
DHT22 Pin	Connect To
VCC	Arduino 5V
DATA	Arduino D2
GND	Arduino GND
Important:

Place a 10 kΩ resistor between VCC and DATA

This resistor ensures stable communication

Step 4️⃣ – Connect the MQ-137 Ammonia Gas Sensor
Pin Connections
MQ-137 Pin	Connect To
VCC	Arduino 5V
GND	Arduino GND
AO	Arduino A0
DO	Not connected

📌 Use AO (Analog Output) for ammonia level measurement.

Step 5️⃣ – Common Power Connections

Connect all GND pins together

Connect all VCC pins to 5V

Use breadboard power rails for neat wiring

Step 6️⃣ – Placement in Refrigerator System
Correct Placement

Arduino + MQ-137 → Outside refrigerator

DHT22 sensor → Inside refrigerator

Run sensor wires through door edge or cable hole

Seal opening using rubber grommet or insulation tape

⚠️ Prevent condensation near electronics.

Step 7️⃣ – Power & Testing

Connect Arduino to PC using USB cable

Upload Arduino code

Open Serial Monitor (9600 baud)

Verify:

Temperature in °C

Humidity in %

Ammonia ADC values

Step 8️⃣ – Final Inspection Checklist ✅

✔ All wires tightly connected
✔ No short circuits
✔ Resistor present on DHT22
✔ MQ-137 warmed up (24–48 hours for accurate readings)
✔ Electronics dry and enclosed
